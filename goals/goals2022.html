        <h1>Goals 2022</h1>

        <h3>Initial considerations</h3>
        <p> This year I'll try to do something different. Last year I tried to put aggresive goals (which is not that bad if you want to push yourself). Although, I got down in the middle and abandoned this track. Not only this, but I didn't do a thing from 2021 goals in of Q3 and Q4.</p>

        <p>So I decided to think better what I expect of this year and try to plan better how to achieve my goals. </p>

        <h4>List of things to consider in planning</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>[ ] Think of who I want to be</li>
            <li>[ ] Think of habits that I need to develop to be who I want to be</li>
            <li>[ ] Think of habits that I need to stop to be who I want to be</li>
            <li>[ ] Make a better plataform to track habits</li>
            <li>[ ] List projects that I want to develop this year</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Projects I want to develop this year</h4>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Final considerations of 2022</h3>
