        <h1>Goals 2021</h1>

        <h3>Final considerations of 2021</h3>

        <p>This year I could learn a lot of Unity and Node (more Unity), although it was mostly by working with it.</p> 
        
        <p>I also acomplished 3 hackathons projects:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cosmo Crashers:</b> really good project made by 5 engineers. Game came out well and we were at top 5.</li>
            <li><b>Bivolt Battle:</b> interesting project. Did a lot more than the previous ones. Although we didn't have time to polish it. I believe that the theme were not right so we didn't receive really good reviews.</li>
            <li><b>Space of Legends:</b> we risked to make a multiplayer game, but we couldn't create the whole multiplayer structure in the time that we had. We delivered an incompleted game.</li>
        </ul>

        Hackathon tauch how to plan ourselves in smaller projects, how to adjust scope to make a project deliverable in a specific amount of time.
        </p>

        <p>I read a technical book: Clean Code. Really good book which improved mine technical knowledge. Although this was not enough. I started to read "The art of game design", but couldn't conclude it.</p>

        <p>I read self improvement books: "Atomic habits" and "Deep Work". Thanks to them I could have a really good Q2, which gave me a really good feedback from my manager.<br>
        Q3 started well, but I started to get really distracted. Which I only recovered a little by the very end of the year. I started to consume a lot of social network, which I couldn't control yet. I'm looking for something that avoid me to use social network and at the same time, allows me to publish my ideas and moments, so it becomes sharable. This should be something to do on 2022.</p>

        <p> Overall, I consider that my 2021 was bellow my expectations. I believe I can improve a lot more putting more effort in what I want to do and I'm not doing, and less effort in what I want to stop doing.</p>
